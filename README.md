# Design Choices

* When in mobile mode, I purposely hid the "scroll mouse down" image since that prompt doesn't make sense for those users.
* When in mobile mode, I purposely hid the image in the "Top 5 reasons Why You Should Apply" because I couldn't find a way to show off the image without wasting a bunch of space without meaningful content.
* The first panel is stretched to the point where it takes up the entirety of the screen for mobile usage to display more of the image, and to present it as a sort of mini-billboard on the device.
